{"posts":[{"title":"chenge-first-blog","text":"润色后的段落： In factory environments with a structured setup, manipulators are typically enclosed by physical barriers to avoid collisions between non-prior dynamic obstacles and manipulators. In intelligent factories, however, these barriers need to be removed for the manipulator to interact with the rest of the factory and perform path tracking tasks in unstructured environments, where non-prior dynamic obstacles may invade the established path. In view of the requirements above, an obstacle avoidance planning algorithm that integrates environmental perception into the feedback loop of motion control is proposed. The global offline method makes planning before execution, meaning that the complete trajectory is determined in advance of the manipulator’s movement. This approach has the advantage of considering factors such as path smoothness[1-2], length[3], execution time, and joint jitter[4-5] of the whole path. However, without environmental perception, the manipulator cannot respond effectively to non-prior obstacles in an open-loop operation. In contrast, the local online planning method does not require the entire path to be planned before execution, but only plans the current motion speed according to the surroundings. Notable methods in this category include the Artificial Potential Field (APF)[6] and Quadratic Programming (QP)[7-10]. To improve the real-time performance of QP optimization, Ma et al.[9] and Xu et al.[10] transformed the obstacle avoidance planning problem into a QP framework and introduced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as solvers. Liu et al.[11] proposed a real-time collision avoidance planning algorithm that combines APF and QP methods. 修改表格： 原句子 修改后的句子 修改原因 In factory structured environments, manipulators are often isolated by physical fences to avoid collisions between non-prior dynamic obstacles and manipulators.

Hu et al.[12] developed a real-time motion planner based on nonlinear model predictive control, which transformed the planning problem into a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) optimization problem. This approach integrated global and local planning and enabled dynamic obstacle avoidance. Jiang et al.[13] extended the APF-guided RRT-Connect offline planning algorithm by re-planning the corresponding path segment when dynamic obstacles invade the offline path. Similarly, Lee et al.[14] first generated an offline path using the Bi-RRT algorithm in static prior obstacle environment and then re-planned the local path when sensors detected that a dynamic obstacle was near the offline trajectory point. In offline global planning, prior environmental obstacles are often described as basic primitives, such as spheres[2, 4, 5] and cuboids[15], which simplifies the representation for planning algorithms. Zimmermann et al.[16] proposed parameterized expressions for these primitives, and derived the analytical expressions of the minimum distance between primitives and their differentials, which can be used to solve the gradient optimization problem in planning. When non-prior dynamic obstacles exist in the workspace, the manipulator must sense the environment during the planning process. In addition to real-time requirements, it is essential to distinguish the manipulator links from the environmental obstacles. 修改表格： 原句子 修改后的句子 修改原因 In the face of complex multiple constraints and uncertainties in dynamic unstructured environments, the planning algorithm combining global and local path planning has become a hot topic in current research.

[17] developed a patch distance sensor attached to the surface of each link of the manipulator, which can detect the distance between the link surface and other objects. To avoid other links of the manipulator from being mistakenly identified as obstacles, they proposed a machine learning based method. A more commonly used sensor is the depth camera, which provides point cloud data (PCD) of the environment to the planning algorithm. Some studies[11, 14] use a URDF filter to exclude the point cloud data corresponding to the manipulator, based on its joint angles. Point cloud segmentation, clustering, and other methods are then applied to obtain the convex hull of each obstacle, which is used to calculate the distance between the obstacles and the manipulator during planning. A more direct approach is to avoid describing the environmental point cloud clustering as a single obstacle. Instead, the nearest distance between any point in the workspace and the manipulator is computed uniformly. Koptev et al.[18] introduced a neural network to solve this distance. Their model takes the manipulator’s joint configuration and the 3D coordinates of an arbitrary point in the workspace as inputs, and outputs the distance between the point and several control points on each link of the manipulator. Similarly, Fujii et al.[1] divided the workspace into 3D grids and proposed a network model to calculate the nearest distance between the center points of all grids and the manipulator, and then determined whether each grid was occupied by the manipulator according to the distance and grid size. The input of the proposed model is the manipulator’s joint configuration, and the output is an array of Boolean values, where each value indicates whether the corresponding spatial grid is occupied by the manipulator. 修改表格： 原句子 修改后的句子 修改原因 Moon et al.
